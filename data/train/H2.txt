Description of Embodiments	SECTION TITLE
The following describes in detail referring to the figures an example embodiment of the present invention.	JURIDICAL TEMPLATE
(A) Configuration of the atmospheric pressure plasma-generating device	EMBODIMENT
Figs. 1 to 3 show an embodiment of the present invention, atmospheric pressure plasma-generating device 10.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Atmospheric pressure plasma-generating device 10 is for generating plasma at atmospheric pressure.	EMBODIMENT
Atmospheric pressure plasma-generating device 10 includes internal block 12, lower block 14, emitting nozzle 18, holding member 20, pair of electrodes 24 and 26, connecting member 28, and upper block 30.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Fig. 1 is a perspective view of atmospheric pressure plasma-generating device 10;	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
fig. 2 is an exploded view showing the atmospheric pressure plasma-generating device 10 without upper block 30;	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
fig. 3 is a cross section of atmospheric pressure plasma-generating device 10.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Internal block 12 is formed of ceramic and, as shown in figs. 4 and 5, is configured from generally cuboid main body section 32 and flange section 34 formed on an upper edge of main body section 32.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Fig. 4 is a perspective view of internal block 12, and fig. 5 is a front view of the internal block 12A, a top view of the internal block 12B, and a side view of the internal block 12C.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
A pair of cylindrical recesses 36 and 38 are formed on an upper surface of flange section 34 of internal block 12.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Further, connecting recess 40 is formed from the bottom surface of the pair of cylindrical recesses 36 and 38 toward the inside of main body section 32 so as to connect the pair of cylindrical recesses 36 and 38.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
The width of connecting recess 40 is smaller than the diameters of cylindrical recesses 36 and 38, so the bottom surfaces of cylindrical recesses 36 and 38 are approximately U-shaped stepped surfaces 46 and 48.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Also, connecting recess 40 has a stepped shape whose width becomes narrower toward the bottom surface, and six first flow paths 50 are formed on the bottom surface of connecting recess 40 so as to extend vertically.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Further, the six first flow paths 50 open to the bottom surface of internal block 12.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Note that, the width direction of a component in this specification means a short direction, that is, a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction when the component is generally rectangular.	DEFINITION
The longitudinal direction is referred to as the length direction.	DEFINITION
As shown in fig. 2, lower block 14 has an approximately cuboid shape and is formed of ceramic.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Accommodation section 60 for accommodating internal block 12 is formed on an upper surface of lower block 14.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Accommodation section 60 is a bottomed hole that opens to an upper surface of lower block 14, and, as shown in fig. 3, is configured from first accommodation section 62 located on the bottom surface side and second accommodation section 64 located on the opening side.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
The depth dimension of first accommodation section 62 is substantially the same as the height dimension of main body section 32 of internal block 12, and the width dimension and length dimension of first accommodation section 62 are slightly longer than the width dimension and length dimension of main body section 32 of internal block 12.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
The depth dimension of second accommodation section 64 is longer than the height dimension of flange section 34 of internal block 12, and the width dimension and length dimension of second accommodation section 64 are slightly longer than the width dimension and length dimension of flange section 34 of internal block 12.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Therefore, internal block 12 is inserted from the opening of accommodation section 60, main body section 32 of internal block 12 is accommodated in first accommodation section 62, and flange section 34 of internal block 12 is accommodated in second accommodation section 64.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Since the depth dimension of second accommodation section 64 is longer than the height dimension of flange section 34, the upper surface of flange section 34, that is, the upper surface of internal block 12 is located below the upper surface of lower block 14 in accommodation section 60. That is, the entire internal block 12 is enclosed in accommodation section 60 of lower block 14.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Six second flow paths 66 are formed on the bottom surface of accommodation section 60, that is, the bottom surface of first accommodation section 62 so as to extend vertically, and the six second flow paths 66 open to the bottom surface of lower block 14.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
By internal block 12 being accommodated in accommodation section 60, second flow paths 66 and first flow paths 50 of internal block 12 are connected.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Emitting nozzle 18 is fixed to a lower surface of lower block 14.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Six third flow paths 70 are formed in emitting nozzle 18 so as to extend vertically, and the six third flow paths 70 open to an upper surface and a lower surface of emitting nozzle 18.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Each of the third flow paths 70 is connected to a respective second flow path 66 of internal block 12.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Holding member 20 is formed of ceramic and, as shown in figs. 6 and 7, is configured from pair of holders 72 and 74 and connecting section 76.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
The pair of holders 72 and 74 are arranged spaced apart from each other with their side surfaces facing each other, and are connected to each other by connecting section 76.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Each of the pair of holders 72 and 74 is configured from main body section 78 and protruding section 80.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Main body section 78 is substantially shaped as a bottomed cylinder.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Protruding section 80 has a short cylindrical shape having a diameter smaller than that of main body section 78, and protrudes slightly downward from the bottom surface of main body section 78.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
The upper end of protruding section 80 opens to the bottom surface of main body section 78.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
The outer diameter of main body section 78 is substantially the same as the width dimension of flange section 34 of internal block 12, and the outer diameter of protruding section 80 is slightly smaller than the inner diameter of cylindrical recesses 36 and 38 of internal block 12.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Further, the axial centers of protruding sections 80 of the pair of holders 72 and 74 are shifted towards each other from the axial center of main body section 78, and the separation distance of the pair of protruding sections 80 is set to be the same as the separation distance of the pair of cylindrical recesses 36 and 38 of internal block 12.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Further, the bottom surface of each main body section 78 of the pair of holders 72 and 74 is a stepped surface, and is configured from first bottom surface 82 and second bottom surface 84.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Second bottom surface 84 protrudes downward from first bottom surface 82.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Second bottom surface 84 is formed to extend in an approximate semi-circle in a direction away from side surfaces 88 that are opposite side surfaces 86 that face each other of protruding sections 80 of the pair of holders 72 and 74.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
That is, first bottom surface 82 is formed on the side surface 86 side of protruding section 80, and second bottom surface 84 is formed on the side surface 88 side of protruding section 80.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Second bottom surface 84 protrudes lower than first bottom surface 82, but is positioned above the lower end of protruding section 80.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Further, connecting section 76 is connected to the pair of holders 72 and 74 on opposite side surfaces to the side surfaces of the pair of holders 72 and 74 that face each other.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
The width dimension of connecting section 76 is approximately the same as the outer diameter of main body section 78 of holders 72 and 74, and the outer wall surface of connecting section 76 and the outer peripheral surface of main body section 78 are smoothly continuous.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Note that, the outer diameter of main body section 78 of holders 72 and 74 is approximately the same as the width dimension of flange section 34 of internal block 12, as described above.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Also, the length dimension of connecting section 76 is designed such that the length dimension of holding member 20 matches the length dimension of flange section 34 of internal block 12.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Thus, the width and length dimensions of holding member 20 are approximately the same as the width and length dimensions of flange section 34 of internal block 12.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Further, bottom surface 90 of connecting section 76 is flush with first bottom surface 82 of main body section 78 of holders 72 and 74, and bottom surface 90 of connecting section 76 and first bottom surface 82 of main body section 78 are smooth flat surfaces.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Connecting section 76 is formed with through-hole 96 extending vertically between the pair of holders 72 and 74, and through-hole 96 opens to the upper surface of connecting section 76 at the upper end and opens to the lower surface of connecting section 76 at the lower end.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
As shown in fig. 3, holding member 20 with such a construction is combined with internal block 12.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
More specifically, protruding sections 80 of the pair of holders 72 and 74 of holding member 20 are inserted into a pair of cylindrical recesses 36 and 38 of internal block 12.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
As a result, the lower end of protruding sections 80 faces stepped surfaces 46 and 48 of cylindrical recesses 36 and 38.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
However, the depth dimension of cylindrical recesses 36 and 38 is greater than the protrusion amount of protruding section 80 from second bottom surface 84.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Therefore, second bottom surface 84 of holding member 20 contacts the top surface of internal block 12, and the lower end of protruding section 80 and stepped surfaces 46 and 48 of cylindrical recesses 36 and 38 face each other with a clearance.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
In this manner, when holding member 20 is combined with internal block 12, connecting recess 40 of internal block 12 is covered by holding member 20 such that reaction chamber 100 is partitioned by connecting recess 40 and holding member 20.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Further, as described above, the width dimension and the length dimension of holding member 20 are approximately the same as the width dimension and the length dimension of flange section 34 of internal block 12.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Therefore, the lower end of holding member 20 combined with internal block 12 is accommodated in second accommodation section 64 of lower block 14 together with flange section 34 of internal block 12.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Each of the pair of electrodes 24 and 26 is generally cylindrical and the outer diameter of electrodes 24 and 26 is smaller than the inner diameter of holders 72 and 74 of holding member 20.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Further, electrodes 24 and 26 are held inside holders 72 and 74 by sockets 102 in a vertically extending attitude.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
The lower ends of electrodes 24 and 26 project from the lower end of holder 72, that is, the lower end of protruding section 80, and are inserted into reaction chamber 100.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Also, the lower ends of electrodes 24 and 26 inserted into reaction chamber 100 are wedge-shaped with their end faces facing each other.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
In detail, the lower ends of the pair of electrodes 24 and 26 slope downwardly from side surfaces 106 of the pair of electrodes 24 and 26 that face each other toward side surfaces 108 that are opposite to side surfaces 106.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
That is, lower end surfaces 110 of the pair of electrodes 24 and 26 slope towards each other.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
In other words, the angle formed by side surface 106 and lower end surface 110 is an obtuse angle, and the angle formed by side surface 108 and lower end surface 110 is an acute angle.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
To put it another way, lower end surface 110 of electrodes 24 and 26 is a tapered surface that goes down from side surface 106 to side surface 108.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Further, connecting member 28 is plate shaped, and insertion hole 120 extending vertically is formed in connecting member 28.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Insertion hole 120 opens to the upper surface of connecting member 28 at the upper end and opens to the lower surface of connecting member 28 at the lower end.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
The inner dimension of insertion hole 120 is slightly larger than the widthwise and lengthwise dimensions of holding member 20.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Also, connecting member 28 is fixed to the upper surface of lower block 14 in a state with holding member 20 inserted through insertion hole 120.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Note that, the upper surface of connecting member 28 and the upper surface of connecting section 76 of holding member 20 are approximately the same height, and the upper ends of holders 72 and 74 of holding member 20, that is, main body section 78, extend upward from the upper surface of connecting member 28.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Upper block 30 has a generally cuboid shape, and formed therein are pair of recesses 126 that open to the lower surface of upper block 30.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
The inner dimension of recesses 126 is slightly larger than the outer dimension of main body section 78 of holders 72 and 74.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Further, lower surface of upper block 30 is fixed to the upper surface of connecting member 28 in a state with main body section 78 of holders 72 and 74 fitted into recesses 126.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
The depth dimension of recesses 126 is larger than the extension amount of main body section 78 from the upper surface of connecting member 28.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Thus, there is clearance between the bottom surface of recess 126 and main body section 78.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Annular elastic body 128 is inserted into the clearance in a compressed state.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
As a result, holding member 20 is biased downward by the elastic force of elastic member 128, and internal block 12 and holding member 20 are in close contact with each other in accommodation section 60 of lower block 14.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Pair of first connecting passages 130 connected to pair of recesses 126 are formed in upper block 30.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
First connecting passage 130 is connected to a supply device (not shown) for supplying a processing gas composed only of an inert gas such as nitrogen.	EMBODIMENT
Further, second connecting passage 132 connected to through-hole 96 of holding member 20 is formed in upper block 30.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Second connecting passage 132 is connected to a supply device (not shown) for supplying processing gas in which an active gas such as oxygen in the air and an inert gas such as nitrogen are mixed at a given ratio.	EMBODIMENT
(B) Generation of plasma by atmospheric pressure plasma-generating device	EMBODIMENT
With atmospheric pressure plasma-generating device 10, processing gas is converted into plasma in reaction chamber 100 by the above-described configuration, and plasma is emitted from third flow path 70 of emitting nozzle 18.	EMBODIMENT
Plasma generation by atmospheric pressure plasma generator 10 is described below in detail.	JURIDICAL TEMPLATE
In atmospheric pressure plasma-generating device 10, processing gas composed only of an inert gas is supplied from first connecting passage 130 to reaction chamber 100 through the inside of holders 72 and 74 of holding member 20.	EMBODIMENT
Processing gas composed of inert gas and active gas is supplied from the second connecting passage 132 to reaction chamber 100 via through-hole 96 of holding member 20.	EMBODIMENT
When this occurs, in reaction chamber 100, pair of electrodes 24 and 26 is energized, and current flows between the pair of electrodes 24 and 26.	EMBODIMENT
Thus, an electrical discharge occurs between the pair of electrodes 24 and 26, and the processing gas is plasmarized by the electrical discharge.	EMBODIMENT
Further, in reaction chamber 100, since electrodes 24 and 26 are arranged at positions close to the wall surface of connecting recess 40 of internal block 12, a current flows along the wall surface of connecting recess 40 by the application of current to electrodes 24 and 26.	EMBODIMENT
As a result, electrical discharge occurs not only between the pair of electrodes 24 and 26, but also along the wall surface of connecting recess 40, and the processing gas is converted into plasma by that discharge.	EMBODIMENT
Then, the plasma generated in reaction chamber 100 flows through first flow path 50 of internal block 12 to second flow path 66 of lower block 14.	EMBODIMENT
Further, the plasma flows into third flow path 70 of emitting nozzle 18, and the plasma is applied to the target object from the lower end of third flow path 70.	EMBODIMENT
(C) Enhancement of durability of atmospheric pressure plasma-generating device	EMBODIMENT
In this manner, with atmospheric pressure plasma-generating device 10, processing gas is converted into plasma by the electrical discharge inside reaction chamber 100, and plasma is emitted from third flow path 70 of emitting nozzle 18.	EMBODIMENT
Note that, plasma refers to a state in which molecules constituting a gas are ionized and separated into positive ions and electrons, and corresponds to an ionized gas.	EMBODIMENT
Such plasma is generated in reaction chamber 100 and is ejected from reaction chamber 100 into first flow path 50.	EMBODIMENT
However, the gas ionized inside reaction chamber 100 is sequentially ejected from reaction chamber 100 to first flow path 50, and when the gas enters a very narrow region, the ionized gas may stay in the narrow region.	EMBODIMENT
For example, with the contact surfaces of the members demarcating reaction chamber 100, since the surfaces are in contact with each other, it is considered that there is no gap.	EMBODIMENT
However, when considering the size of the molecules that constitute a gas, ionized gas enters between adjacent members even if the surfaces of the members contact each other.	EMBODIMENT
When the ionized gas enters between contact surfaces forming such a very narrow region, the ionized gas stays inside the contact surfaces, and the discharge concentrates on the ionized gas, which may cause charring of the contact surfaces.	INVENTION_PROBLEM
In particular, with reaction chamber 100, since discharge is generated between pair of electrodes 24 and 26, if a contact surface exists between the pair of electrodes 24 and 26, the contact surface is likely to be charred, and members demarcating reaction chamber 100, that is, internal block 12, holding member 20, and the like, are likely to deteriorate.	INVENTION_PROBLEM
In addition, there is a fear that the discharge will not be stable due to the concentration of discharge on the contact surface.	INVENTION_PROBLEM
In view of this, atmospheric pressure plasma-generating device 10 is configured such that in reaction chamber 100, there is only a contact surface on the side opposite to pair of electrodes 24 and 26.	INVENTION_PROBLEM
More specifically, as described above, reaction chamber 100 is demarcated by holding member 20 and internal block 12, and protruding sections 80 of pair of holders 72 and 74 of holding member 20 are inserted into pair of cylindrical recesses 36 and 38 of internal block 12.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
As a result, the lower end of protruding sections 80 faces stepped surfaces 46 and 48 of cylindrical recesses 36 and 38.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
However, the depth dimension of cylindrical recesses 36 and 38 is greater than the protrusion amount of protruding section 80 from second bottom surface 84.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Therefore, second bottom surface 84 of holding member 20 contacts the top surface of internal block 12, and the lower end of protruding section 80 and stepped surfaces 46 and 48 of cylindrical recesses 36 and 38 face each other with a clearance.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
That is, only second bottom surface 84 of holding member 20 contacts internal block 12.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
To put it another way, as shown in fig. 8, on the upper surface of flange section 34 of internal block 12, only a portion (oblique lines in the drawing) corresponding to the shape of second bottom surface 84 of holding member 20 becomes contact surface 140 to holding member 20.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
This contact surface 140 is located on the opposite side to the position between pair of electrodes 24 and 26 inserted into connecting recess 40 of internal block 12.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
That is, with atmospheric pressure plasma-generating device 10, in reaction chamber 100, the contact surface between internal block 12 and holding member 20, that is, second bottom surface 84 and contact surface 140, is provided only on the side opposite to the position between pair of electrodes 24 and 26.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Note that, the space between pair of electrodes 24 and 26 is a width corresponding to the diameters of electrodes 24 and 26, and does not only represent a region connecting pair of electrodes 24 and 26, but also represents a region between two straight lines that are perpendicular to a straight line connecting pair of electrodes 24 and 26 and that pass through pair of electrodes 24 and 26.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Specifically, the region connecting pair of electrodes 24 and 26 with a width corresponding to the diameters of electrodes 24 and 26 is an area surrounded by single-dash broken line 146 in fig. 8.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
On the other hand, two straight lines passing through pair of electrodes 24 and 26 and perpendicular to the straight line connecting pair of electrode 24 and 26 are the two-dash broken lines 148 in fig. 8.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Thus, between pair of electrodes 24 and 26 means between the two two-dash broken lines 148.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
That is, with atmospheric pressure plasma-generating device 10, in reaction chamber 100, the contact surface between internal block 12 and holding member 20 exists only on the side opposite to the space between the pair of two-dash broken lines 148.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
On the other hand, as shown in fig. 9, conventional atmospheric pressure plasma-generating device 150 includes pair of holders 152, internal block 154, connecting member 156, lower block 158, an emitting nozzle (not shown), and an upper block (not shown).	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Here, with atmospheric pressure plasma-generating device 150, the inner portion of internal block 154 functions as a reaction chamber by assembling the lower surfaces of pair of holders 152 to the upper surface of internal block 154.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Therefore, only holders 152 and internal block 154 will be described.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
The pair of holders 152 have a cylindrical shape, and a lower end surface of the cylindrical shape is a flat surface.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Further, internal block 154 includes generally cuboid main body section 166 and flange section 168 formed at the upper end of main body section 166.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Recess 170 is formed on internal block 154 and recess 170 opens to the upper surface of flange section 168 and into the interior of main body section 166.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Except for recess 170, the upper surface of flange section 168 is flat, and flange section 168 has a width dimension substantially the same as the diameter of holders 152.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Further, holders 152 and internal block 154 are combined such that the lower surface of holders 152 contacts the upper surface of internal block 154, that is, the upper surface of flange section 168.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
As a result, recess 170 of internal block 154 is demarcated by holders 152 as a reaction chamber.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Further, by pair of electrodes 176 and 178 (refer to fig. 10) being inserted into pair of holders 152, the lower ends of the pair of electrodes 176 and 178 enter inside recess 170.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
As described above, with atmospheric pressure plasma-generating device 150, holders 152 and internal block 154 are combined so that the lower end surfaces of flat holders 152 contact the upper end surface of flat internal block 154.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Due to this, as shown in fig. 10, a portion of the upper surface of internal block 154 corresponding to the shape of the lower end surface of holders 152 (oblique lines in the drawing) becomes contact surface 180 at which contact to holders 152 occurs.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Contact surface 180 extends between pair of electrodes 176 and 178.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
That is, contact surface 180 extends into the region between two straight lines 182 that pass through pair of electrodes 176 and 178 and perpendicular to the straight line connecting the pair of electrodes 176 and 178.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
In this manner, when the contact surface between holders 152 and internal blocks 154 demarcating the reaction chamber exists between the pair of electrodes 176 and 178, gas ionized by the electrical discharge generated between electrodes 176 and 178 easily enters contact surface 180.	EMBODIMENT
In particular, when discharge occurs along the wall surface demarcating the reaction chamber, ionized gas easily enters contact surface 180.	EMBODIMENT
When ionized gas enters contact surface 180 and remains, the discharge concentrates on contact surface 180.	EMBODIMENT
This causes contact surface 180 to be charred and deteriorate.	INVENTION_PROBLEM
In this manner, with conventional atmospheric pressure plasma-generating device 150, holders 152 and internal block 154 that demarcate the reaction chamber are liable to deteriorate and are not durable.	REFERENCE_PROBLEM
In order to improve the durability, it is conceivable to use a material having high heat resistance as the material of holders 152 or the like, but the costs are high.	INVENTION_PROBLEM
On the other hand, with atmospheric pressure plasma-generating device 10, as shown in fig. 8, in reaction chamber 100, contact surface 140 between internal block 12 and holding member 20 exists only on side opposite to the position between the pair of electrodes 24 and 26.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
That is, contact surface 140 between internal block 12 and holding member 20 does not exist between the pair of electrodes 24 and 26.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Therefore, even if discharge occurs between pair of electrodes 24 and 26, ionized gas does not easily penetrate into contact surface 140 between internal block 12 and holding member 20.	EMBODIMENT
In addition, even if discharge occurs from pair of electrodes 24 and 26 along the walls that demarcate reaction chamber 100, penetration to contact surface 140 does not occur easily.	EMBODIMENT
As a result, deterioration of contact surface 140 between internal block 12 and holding member 20 due to charring can be prevented, and durability of internal block 12 and holding member 20 is improved.	INVENTION_ADVANTAGE
In this manner, with atmospheric pressure plasma-generating device 10, by devising the shape of internal block 12 and the like without changing the materials of internal block 12 and the like, the high costs due to material change are prevented, and the durability of internal block 12 and the like is improved.	INVENTION_ADVANTAGE
Further, by suppressing the concentration of discharge on the contact surface, stable discharge is ensured.	INVENTION_ADVANTAGE
Also, as shown in fig. 3, protruding section 80 that protrudes down from second bottom surface 84 is formed between second bottom surface 84 of holding member 20 and electrodes 24 and 26, and stepped surfaces 46 and 48 that are recessed downward are formed between contact surface 140 of internal block 12 and electrodes 24 and 26.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
In addition, protruding section 80 and stepped surfaces 46 and 48 face each other with a clearance.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
By this configuration, the contact surface between internal block 12 and holding member 20 is positioned above the lower ends of electrodes 24 and 26.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
Also, protruding section 80 extends to cover the contact surface between internal block 12 and holding member 20.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
As a result, gas ionized by the electrical discharge between electrodes 24 and 26 is less likely to penetrate the contact surface between internal block 12 and holding member 20, thus further improving the durability of internal block 12 and the like.	INVENTION_ADVANTAGE
Note that, holding member 20 is supported by the upper surface of internal block 12 only at second bottom surface 84 of pair of holders 72 and 74.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
That is, holders 72 and 74 are supported by the upper surface of internal block 12 only at one of the ends of the bottom surface of the approximate cylindrical holders, meaning that the stability is low.	INVENTION_PROBLEM
Thus, pair of holders 72 and 74 are connected by connecting section 76 to ensure the stability of holding member 20.	INVENTION_ADVANTAGE
(D) Stable generation of plasma by electrode discharge	EMBODIMENT
With atmospheric pressure plasma-generating device 10, as described above, discharge occurs between electrodes 24 and 26 to generate plasma.	EMBODIMENT
Therefore, with atmospheric pressure plasma-generating device 10, the lower ends of electrodes 24 and 26 are wedge-shaped in order to achieve stable discharge between the electrodes.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
More specifically, in a conventional atmospheric pressure plasma-generating device, electrodes have a cylindrical shape, and the angle formed by the side surface of the electrode and the lower end surface of the electrode is a right angle.	REFERENCE
That is, at the lower ends of a pair of electrodes, the corners at which the sides and the lower end meet at 90 degrees face each other, and the lower end surfaces face directly downward and do not face each other at all.	REFERENCE
Discharge occurs between the lower ends of the pair of electrodes by supplying electric power to the pair of electrodes.	REFERENCE
Here, since the lower end surfaces of the pair of electrodes are not facing each other at all, discharge does not occur easily between the lower end surface one of the pair of electrodes and the lower end surface of the other electrode, and it is considered that discharge is generated between the 90-degree corner portion of one of the pair of electrodes and the 90-degree corner portion of the other electrode.	REFERENCE
Such concentrated discharge at the corners of the electrodes can cause slight disturbances in the power supplied to the electrodes.	REFERENCE_PROBLEM
More specifically, when a current is stably supplied to the electrode, the current changes periodically.	REFERENCE_PROBLEM
On the other hand, in a conventional atmospheric pressure plasma-generating device, the amplitude may decrease in several cycles out of several hundred to several thousand cycles.	REFERENCE_PROBLEM
In such a case, the discharge may stop for a moment, which is undesirable.	REFERENCE_PROBLEM
In view of this, with atmospheric pressure plasma-generating device 10, the lower ends of electrodes 24 and 26 are wedge-shaped, and lower end surfaces 110 of pair of electrodes 24 and 26 face each other.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
That is, at the lower ends of pair of electrodes 24 and 26, the corner portions where side surface 106 and lower end surface 110 form an obtuse angle face each other, and lower end surfaces 110 also face each other.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
It is considered that discharge occurs between the corner with the obtuse angle of one of the pair of electrodes 24 and 26 and the corner with the obtuse angle of the other electrode, and that discharge occurs between the lower end surface 110 of one of the pair of electrodes 24 and 26 and the lower end surface 110 of the other of the electrodes by electric power being supplied to the pair of electrodes 24 and 26.	FIGURE DESCRIPTION
In this case, electric power is stably supplied to the electrode as compared with the case where electric discharges are concentrated between the 90-degree corner portion of one of the pair of electrodes and the 90-degree corner portion of the other electrodes.	INVENTION_ADVANTAGE
That is, the amplitude does not decrease even for several cycles out of several hundred to several thousand cycles.	INVENTION_ADVANTAGE
As a result, discharge occurs stably between the electrodes, and stable generation of plasma can be ensured.	INVENTION_ADVANTAGE
